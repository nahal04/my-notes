## Introduction

It is the fifth most common cancer in the world. It is the most common type of cancer in countries like Japan. Therefore they have intensified screening strategies against gastric cancer.

## Risk Factors

Given below are the few common risk factors of gastric cancer

1. ***H. pyrlori*** infection is considered the single most important risk factor for gastric cancer. Chronic infection with *H. pylori* can lead to either atrophic or non atrophic gastritis. This chronic gastritis paves a way for cellular metaplasia into intestinal type and further can cause cellular dysplasia. This intestinal type metaplastic cells can later on become atypical and turn malignant leading to intestinal type gastric carcinoma

2. **Dietary factors** like increased salt intake and ingestion of nitrates cause an high risk of peptic ulcers as well as gastric carcinoma. nitrated gets converted into N-nitroso compounds within the stomach, which acts as a carcinogen.

3. There is also a **genetic** correlation that has been found out. Mutation in gene cell adhesion molecule E cadherin (CDH1), Lynch syndrome, Hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), Li- Fraumeni syndrome are a few examples.

4. **Gastric polyps** has an high risk of transforming into malignancy. Any polyp > 1cm is excised endoscopically.

5. **PPIs** on long term use can increase the pH in the stomach. This creates a better environment for *H. pylori* to proliferate leading to atrophic gastritis and then malignancies.

6. In **Pernicious anemia**, autoantibodies destroy the gastric parietal and chief cells leading to achlorhydria and the sequence of events mentioned above as in chronic PPI usage. In fact anything that causes reduced acid secretion in stomach carries a long term risk of gastric cancer. So is the case of increased acid secretion. Everything should be properly balanced.

7. Other risk factors include Obesity, Ebstein Barr virus infection, smoking and irradiation.

## Pathology 

There are many classifications for gastric cancer pathology:

1. Borrmann classification:
    - Type 1 => polypoid
    - Type 2 => fungating
    - Type 3 => ulcerating
    - Type 4 => diffuse (linitis plastica, signet ring cell carcinoma)


2. Lauren's classification:
    - Intestinal type
    - Diffuse type

3. Japanese classification
4. French classification
