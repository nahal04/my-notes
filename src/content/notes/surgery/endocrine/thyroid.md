## Introduction

The name "thyroid" is derived from the greek word *thyreoeides* meaning shield-shaped. Thyroid is therefore a shield-shaped or butterfly-shaped gland present in the neck. There is a lot more to be discussed of thyroid but we will start with its embryology, and then move on to its anatomy.

## Embryology

The thyroid gland develops from the primitive foregut. It originates as an outpouching from the foramen cecum present on the base of tongue. This is called the medial thyroid anlage. It descends down and lies in the anterior part of the neck. The endodermal cells present in the anlage forms the follicular cells of thyroid, which produce the thyroid hormone. But, that's not it! The thyroid gland is also responsible for the formation of another hormone - calcitonin. However calcitonin is formed from another group of cells in thyroid gland called parafollicular cells or C cells. These cells are embryologically derived from neuroectoderm or more precisely from the ultimobranchial body. It forms as an outpouching in the 4th pharyngeal pouch. This is called the lateral thyroid anlage. The C cells come to lie in the postero-superior aspect of thyroid gland.

The descend of thyroid gland per se still leaves back an epithelium lined tract connecting the foramen cecum to the thyroid gland, called *thyroglossal duct*. It later obliterates in intrauterine life and may persist as a fibrous tract. However in some individuals a part of the duct fails to obliterate and thus forms a thyroglossal cyst. A thyroglossal cyst moves up with protrusion of trunk and can be confirmed by an ultrasound scan. The surgical treatment of thyroglossal cyst is called **Systrunk operation** - en bloc cystectomy with excision of central hyoid bone.
