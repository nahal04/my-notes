## Thyrotoxicosis
It is a syndrome due to an elevated level of thyroid hormone in the blood, which not necessarily is produced by the thyroid

> #### Hyperthyroidism
>
> Even though the term hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis is used interchangeably, there is a wide difference between hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland and only thyroid gland is secreting excess thyroid hormone, whereas thyrotoxicosis can be due to hyperthyroidism, an ectopic thyroid, exogenously supplied thyroid hormone and so on. That said, hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis will be used interchangeably in this note.

### Conditions causing thyrotoxicosis

1. **Diffuse toxic goitre**/ Primary thyrotoxicosis/ Graves disease
2. **Toxic nodular goitre**/ Secondary thyrotoxicosis/ Plummer's disease
3. **Toxic nodule**/ Toxic adenoma
4. Thyrotoxicosis factitia: Excess exogenous thyroid hormone
5. Jod-Basedow thyrotoxicosis: *Jod* means Iodine. When and individual suffers from iodine deficiency goitre, the thyroid gland become enlarged to meet the normal thyroxine requirements. The gland also turn Iodine avid. When such individuals are supplied with Iodine, they suddenly produce a large amount of thyroxine causing thyrotoxicosis.
6. Thyroiditis: The most common of this is Hashimoto thyroiditis. In this condition autoimmunity develops against the follicular cells, causing inflammation and rupture of follicle. This releases a large amount of thyroxine into the circulation causing a transient thyrotoxicosis (Hashitoxicosis) which is followed by a state of hypothyroidism.

7. Malignancy: Usually in malignancy, the cells are poorly differentiated and therefore fails to produce good levels of thyroxine. However, when there is a large tumour, the number of cells more than compensates for their inability to produce thyroid hormone causing thyrotoxicosis
8. Paraneoplastic syndromes: Trophoblastic tumor
9. Ectopic thyroid: Struma ovarii

### Primary vs Secondary thyrotoxicosis

| | Primary thyrotoxicosis | Secondary thyrotoxicosis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Age** |  younger age | middle aged |
| **Onset** | Goitre and hyperthyroidism present almost simultaneously | goitre present for years before hyperthyroidism develop |
| **Symptoms** | Calorigenic and CNS | CVS |
| **Signs** | All eye signs present, diffuse enlargement, bruit present | only lid related eye signs present , nodular enlargement |
| **Complications** | Obstructive symptoms uncommon | Obstructive symptoms common |
| **Treatment** | Antithyroid therapy. Surgery done if needed | Definite role for surgery |

> Toxic multinodular goitre has a higher chance of malignant transformation in follicular carcinoma of thyroid as the disease process is very long term

## Graves' disease

TSI (thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin) is produced which mimics TSH and acts on the TSH receptor. There is also an antigenic similarity between the orbital tissue and thyroid which causes thyroid ophthalmopathy.

### Clinical features of thyrotoxicosis

#### Symptoms

- Calorigenic: increased apetite, loss of weight inspite of good apetite, heat intolerance, excessive sweating, palpitation etc.
- Nervous: Tremors,anxiety,nervousness,increased activity. Tremor is elicited by observing the tongue resting in the oral cavity.
- CVS: Dyspnoea, palpitations, pedal edema (due to CCF)
- Ocular : Diplopia, pain and increased lacrimation (due to corneal ulcer)
- Amenorrhea/ infrequent menstruation
- Hyperdefecation

#### Signs

- Diffuse enlargement with bruit and visible pulsations. Pulsations over thyroid is felt in the upper pole of thyroid, where the superficial superior thyroid artery is palpable. Inferior thyroid artery supplies posteriorly and is less superficial. Therefore it is difficult to palpate the inferior thyroid artery.
- Increased sleeping pulse rate (sleeping pulse is checked because when the patient is awake, he may be anxious due to hyperthyroidism which may cause a rise in pulse rate)
- Abnormal rhythm of pulse

> #### Stages of development of thyrotoxic arrhythmias
> 1. Multiple extra systoles
> 2. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia
> 3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
> 4. Persistent AF not responding to digoxin.

### Thyroid Eye Signs

- Von Graefe's sign: lid lag
- Darlymple sign: widened palpebral fissure
- Stellwag sign: infrequent blinking
- Nafziger's sign: proptosis/ true exophthalmos (observe from above the patient to look for protrusion of eyeball beyond eyebrows)
- Moebius sign: inability to converge (medial rectus palsy)
- Joffroy's sign: Absence of forehead wrinkles on looking up (because the eye is protruded out and the patient can see above easily)

> All the lid signs are caused due to increased sensitization of muller's muscle to catecholamines. Exophthalmos is caused by edema fluid and round cell infiltration in the retro-orbital space. There is also fibroblast proliferation and increased glycosaminoglycans production induced by TSI in the retro-orbital space in Graves' disease.

### Signs diagnostic of thyrotoxicosis

- Thyroid dermopathy: pretibial myxedema due to deposition of GAG
- Thyroid acropachy: dermopathy with clubbing of toes
- Tremors: outstretched hands, tongue

### Diagnosis

- Mostly clinical diagnosis
- TFT: raised T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub> with scanty TSH
- Thyroid scan: diffuse increased uptake
- FNAC: relative contraindication when thyrotoxicosis is present 
- Histopathology: follicular hypertrophy with scanty colloid due to overstimulation of thyroid
