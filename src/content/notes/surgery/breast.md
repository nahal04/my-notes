## Anatomy and Histology

Breast is a modified apocrine sweat gland bestowed with a divine function of nursing and feeding. It is located in the subcutaneous plain over the chest wall extending from the 2nd to 6th rib cranio-caudally and from the lateral border of the sternum upto the anterior axillary line medio-laterally. The upper outer quadrant of the breast has an extension to the axilla, called the axillary tail of Spence. At the center of each breast lies a projection lined by stratified squamous epithelium, called the nipple. The nipple is surrounded by a region of pigmented skin termed as the areola which contains multiple tubercles of Montgomery. The nipple and areola is densely innervated as well, which plays a major role in the milk ejection reflex mediated by Oxytocin.

Inside the breast, the tissues can be divided into ductolobular system, intralobular stroma, interlobular stroma and adipose tissue. Multiple acini are present in the breast from which milk is secreted. These acini and their ductules group together to form lobules in breast. The lobules are surrounded by what is called as the intralobular stroma. Multiple such lobules are present in a single breast. Each such lobules are seperated by interlobular stroma. Each lobules drain the milk to a major duct called the lactiferous duct which finally drain out through the nipple. Just before the nipple, the lactiferous ducts form a dilatation called the ampulla, which servers the purpose of temporary storage of milk. These sophisticated arrangement of tissue is well defines only after attainment of puberty and thus forms the **terminal duct lobular unit** (TDLU). All throughout, the TDLU is lined by two layers of epithelium - an inner luminal cells and an outer myoepithelial cells.

After 30 years of age, the breast undergoes apoptosis of ductolobular epithelium and regression of fibrous stroma to be replaced by more of adipose tissue. Apart from all the tissues mentioned above there is also a ligament which connecta the pectoral fascia to the skin of the breast. This is called the Cooper's ligament.

## Developmental anomalies of the breast

Breast develops from the mammary ridge which extends from the axilla to the groin in mammals. However in humans, it extends only upto upper chest. Of these, only one nipple and breast on each side persists during development. Presence of more than one breast is termed polymastia and absence of the breast is called amastia. Same way, presence of multiple nipples are termed supernumary nipples and absence of nipple is termed athelia. Presence os of more than one nipple for a single breast is termed polythelia.

Some individuals may develop an accessory breast in the axilla which may be left behind during mastectomies. Another common entity is the congenitally inverted nipple. This is not a serious condition and usually corrects itself following pregnancy or during lactation. Some may require a manual eversion of the nipple. More serious is a recent acquired inversion of nipple, which suggests of a malignancy affecting the lactiferous ducts.

## Benign diseases of the breast

The benign disorders of breast had many names in the past and a haphazard classification. Now all of them are brought under the single umbrella of **aberrations of normal development and involution (ANDI)** of the breast.

### Pathology

1. Hyperplasia of the ductal or lobular epithelium. Presence of more than 2 epithelial layer in any part of the duct or lobules is termed as hyperplasia in breast. These hyperplasia may contain cells with or without atypia. If atypia is present, it is called Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) or atypical lobular hyperplasia. If this hyperplasia is present in 2 or more ducts or for more than 2mm region, it is considered as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
2. Papilloma: it is a projection of the duct epithelium. The papilloma contains a fibrous core surrounded by epithelium. It can be a solitary papilloma, papillomatosis (multiple papilloma) or juvenille papillomatosis (swiss cheese disease with a palpable lump), each one having a progressive risk of carcinoma.
3. Cyst formation can happen due to obstruction of ducts or ductules followed by subsequent accumulation of seceretions in the acini.
