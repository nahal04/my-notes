## Giardiasis
- It exists in cyst form or trophozoite form
- Infection is acquired from food with cyst. It then forms the trophozoite and then infect the brush bordered epithelium. The trophozoite then matures into cyst and is excreted.

### Clinical features
- Diarrhea/ asymptomatic
- Malabsorption: failure to thrive
- Abdominal pain
- low grade fever

### Diagnosis
- clinical history and examination
- stool microscopy - cyst or trophozoite
- EIA (enzyme immuno assay)

### Treatment
- Metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day => 5 to 7 days
- Tinidazole 50 mg/kg once daily for 3 days
- Albendazole 400mg od for 5 days

## Amebiasis

- caused by entamoeba histolytica

> #### Commensal amebae
> - E. coli
> - E. hartmanni
> - E. gingivalis
> - E. polecki

- life cycle is same as giardia except for that the trophozoite create a flask shaped ulcer in the intestine most commonly large intestine and note the brush bordered intestine

### Clinical features
- dyssentry
- diarrhea
- tenesmus
- amoebic liver abcess

>| Amoebic dyssentry | Bacillary dyssentry |
>| --- | --- |
>| Blood mixed with stools | stools are followed by blood |
>| Less frequency | More frequency |
>| Non toxic, mild fever | High grade fever, toxic looking child |
>| foul smelling | Non foul smelling |
>| less dehydration | severe dehydration |

### Investigations
- stool microscopy: cyst
- Indirect hemagglutination test - heterophile antigen test
- Real time PCR

### Treatment
a. Invasive amebiasis
    - Syr. Metronidazole: 35 to 50 mg/kg/day for 7 to 10 days
    - Tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day for 3 to 5 days

b. Luminal amebicides:
    - paromomycin
    - diloxanide furoate
