## Introduction

*Helminth* means worm. Intestinal parasites consists of 3 types of helminths:

- Nematodes (round worms)
- Cestodes (tapeworms)
- Trematodes (Flukes)

## Ascaris lumbricoides (Round worm)
- 30 cm in size

### Life cycle
![Life cycle of ascaris](/diagrams/ascaris.png)

### Risk factors
- poor sanitation
- use of human faeces as manure
- Geophagia
- Pre-school and early school children

- Adult in soil can remain in soil upto 2 yrs
- 1 female lays 2 lakh eggs
- Eggs are viable for 2 yrs at 10&deg;C

### Clinical features
- worm in intestine:
  - Abdominal discomfort, distension, vomiting
  - Failure to thrive, nutritional deficiency
  - Intestinal obstruction
  - Cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis (spread of worms)
- larva in lung:
  - Allergic manifestations
  - fever
  - eosinophilia
  - urticaria
  - granulomatous disease

### Diagnosis
1. Worm in stools
2. Stool microscopy: fertilized eggs are seen
3. USG abdomen
4. ERCP (to extract worm out)

### Treatment
- Albendazole 400 mg once daily (for children less than 2yrs 200mg is used)
OR
- Mebendazole 100mg bd x 3 days
- Piperazine citrate 75mg/kg/day for 2 days => it causes paralysis of the parasite and thereby helps in expulsion of the parasites in intestinal obstruction

> #### Advantages of albendazole
> - Single dose
> - It is larvicidal, wormicidal and ovicidal

> #### Dosage of Albendazole
> - If the worm is present in the intestine, it is taken 1 1/2 hrs following dinner
> - otherwise, it is taken along with a fatty meal to improve the absorption

### Prevention
- hygiene, clean water, washing vegetables
- Health education
- National Deworming Day (NDD): 10th Feb and 10th Aug

## Ancylostoma duodenale (Hook Worm)
- 1 cm in size

### Life cycle
![Life cylce of ancylostoma](/diagrams/ancylostoma.png)

### Risk Factors
- Same as Ascaris infection as given above

### Clinical features
- Worm in intestine
  - each worm suck out a blood of 0.2ml/day
  - in heavy infections, 100 worms may be present which cause a blood loss of 20ml/day causing anemia and anasarca
- lung: cough
- skin: vesicles which rupture on scratching and form crusts

### Treatment
- Albendazole 400mg once daily, or
- Mebendazole 200mg bd for 3 days

## Enterobius vermicularis (Pin worm)
- very common infection in India
- 1 cm in size

### Life cycle
![Life cycle of enterobius](/diagrams/enterobius.png)

### Clinical features
- generally asymptomatic
- appendicitis, salpingitis, hepatitis, peritonitis and PID
  
### Diagnosis
- Cellophane pressed against perianal region shows eggs
- worms can be visualised in the perianal region at night

### Treatment
- Albendazole 400mg od
- Mebendazole 200mg bd
- Pyrental palmoate is given in children < 6months

> #### Note on mebendazole
>  - penetrate blood brain barrier
>  - No syrup form available therefore preferred in children > 2yrs

### Prevention
- Bath in the morning
- Frequent change of underwear

## Taenia Saginata (Beef Tapeworm)
- 4 to 10 cm in length

### Life cycle
![Life cycle of Taenia saginata](/diagrams/taenia-solium.png)

### Clinical features
- abdominal discomfort
- peranal pruritus

### Diagnosis

Stool sample

### Treatment

Praziquantel 25 mg/kg per oral single dose

---

## Taenia Solium (Pork Tapeworm)
- can also spread from vegetables
- life cycle is same as beef tapeworm

### Clinical features
- abdominal discomfort
- cysts in brain (focal seizures)

### Diagnosis
- visual examination of proglottids in stool
- MRI brain: NCC;SREL: <2 cm
- ELISA: Ab in serum

### Treatment
- Albendazole 15mg/kg/day per oral for 7 days with fatty meal
- Steroids for 2wks started 48 hrs before albendazole
- Cyst break and cause inflammation this can lead to damage in the eye.
- Phenytoin is started 2 days before albendazole and continued for 2 months.

### Prevention
Cooking

> All treatment is repeated after 2 wks, which is the time by which the larvae which were present earlier develop into adults. Most of the drugs act only against adults.
>
> When larval cysts enter the host, adults are produced in the intestine and likewise when eggs enter the host, larval cysts reach the intestine causing cysticercosis. Therefore autoinfection with egg again is almost necessary to develop cysticercosis.
