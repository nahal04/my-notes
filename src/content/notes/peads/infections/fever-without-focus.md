## Definitions
- Normal temperature: rectal temperature of 37 to 37.5&deg;C. There is a physiological rise of 0.5&deg;C in the evening
- Rectal temp is 0.4&deg;C higher than oral temperature and 1&deg;C higher than axillary temperature
- Fever is defined as rectal temperature &gt; 38&deg;C or 100.4&deg;F
- Hyperpyrexia is defined as rectal temperature &gt; 40&deg;C or 104&deg;F

## Pathogenesis
  1. Pyrogens: elevation of set point of temperature in the hypothalamus by any of the following:
       - exogenous (pathogens)
       - endogenous (cytokines)
  2. Heat production more than heat loss (Malignant hyperthermia, Salicylate poisoning)
  3. Defective loss of heat (ectodermal dysplasia)

## Response to hyperthermia

- Sweating
- blood is redirected to cutaneous vessels
- regulate ECF via AVP
- behavioral

## Classification of fever

## Fever without localising signs
### Neonates (&lt; 3 months)
- Causative organisms: *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Streptococcus*
- Common sites: UTI, sepsis, meningitis
- Management: All neonates with febrile illness should be hospitalized. Blood, urine and CSF culture is done.
- Empirical treatment: Cefotaxime or Ampicillin + Gentamycin (ampigenta)

### 1 - 3 months
- mostly viral but also can be bacterial
- common bacteria: *E. coli*, group B *streptococcus*, *S.* *aureus*
- common manifestation: pyelonephritis
#### Management
Classify as well looking or sick looking child. It is done by any of the following protocols:
  - Boston criteria
  - Philadelphia criteria
  - Pittsburgh criteria
  - Rochester criteria
- if child is sick looking, child is admitted and then empirical treatment is given and evaluated
- if child is well looking, treatment can be done in an OPD basis with follow up evaluation
- Negative predictive value of serious bacterial infection is &gt; 98%
- However empirical treatment is given - Cefotaxime

> In short, the child may be considered well looking if:
> - No visible infections
> - TLC between 5k and 15k
> - Normal blood culture
> - Normal urine culture

### 3 to 36 months
- 30% have no localizing sign
- mostly viral
- if sick looking, the child is admitted and culture is done
- empirical treatment include Cefotaxime

## PUO (Pyrexia of Unknown origin)

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) was first described by Dr. Petersdorf and Dr. Beesom in 1961. FUO was defined as a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Centigrade) or higher with a minimum duration of three weeks without an established diagnosis after an intensive one-week investigation in the hospital

### Classification of PUO

1. Classic PUO
2. Nosocomial PUO
3. Neutropenic PUO
4. HIV associated PUO

### Etiology
Atypical presentation of common diseases like:
- TB
- Enteric fever
- HIV
- Malignancy - leukemia
- JIA - systemic onset JIA first produce systemic symptoms long before joint symptoms
- SLE
- Drugs - commonly seen with Vancomycin. The very drug that is given to treat the cause of fever may become the cause of fever

### Evaluation
#### History
- history of fever:
    1. Intermittent fever: A fever that comes and goes over a period of time - Malaria
    2. Remittent fever: A fever that fluctuates but does not return to normal body temperature - TB, rheumatic fever
    3. Continuous fever: A fever that remains constant without any significant fluctuation - Scrub typhus
    4. Relapsing fever: A fever that occurs in cycles, with periods of high fever followed by periods of normal body temperature - Lyme disease
    5. Low-grade fever: A fever that is slightly elevated, usually between 99°F (37.2°C) and 100.9°F (38.3°C) - common in PUO
    6. High-grade fever: A fever that is higher than 101°F (38.3°C) - UTI
    > #### Fever with chills and Rigor
    > - chills represent a feeling of coldness and shivering
    > - rigor is much more severe than chills and is charecterised by sever involuntary contractions to produce heat, with chattering of teeth.
    > - chills and rigor is commonly seen in Malaria, flu, sepsis, UTIs etc.
- Past history
- Travel history
- contact with animals
- drug history

### Examination
Head to toe examination is done for various clues

### Evaluation
- first line of investigations are done at first
- if diagnosis is note reached second line investigations are done

### Treatment
- antibiotics are not started in a well looking child
- all sick looking children are admitted to hospital
- if source is identified, the source is treated
- otherwise, categorical workup is done. It includes addressing infectious, immunologic, oncologic and immunodeficiency-related causes.
