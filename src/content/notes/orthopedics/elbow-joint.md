## Anatomy

Understanding the anatomy of the elbow joint is key to the understanding of various actions and injuries occurring at the elbow joint. To begin with, the elbow joint is formed by the articulation of three bones: distal humerus, proximal radius and proximal ulna. The radial head articulates with a process in the distal humerus called the capitulum to form the radio-capitular joint. The ulnar trochlear fossa articulates with the humeral trochlear process to form the ulno-humeral joint. Finally, one more joint is considered to be a part of the elbow joint, that is, the proximal radio-ulnar joint formed between the radial head and radial notch of the ulna.

Now that we understood the various articulations present in the elbow joint, it's time to mention that the elbow joint is a complex hinge joint and not a simple hinge joint. It is considered to be a complex hinge joint because the elbow joint is a combination of a hinge joint and a pivot joint. The radio-capitular joint along with the proximal radio-ulnar joint acts as a pivot joint and helps in forearm rotation (pronation-supination). On the other hand, the ulno-humeral joint acts as a hinge joint and helps in flexion and extension at the elbow joint. This combination helps the human being to carry out a wide range of movements.

The elbow joint is a synovial joint with a joint capsule lined by synovial membrane. Apart from the joint capsule, the elbow joint is stabilized by various ligaments.

### Ligaments of the elbow joint

The elbow joint is stabilized by several ligaments, which are strong bands of fibrous tissue that connect the bones of the elbow joint and provide stability to the joint. The ligaments of the elbow can be divided into three main groups: the medial ligaments, the lateral ligaments, and the annular ligament.

1. Medial ligaments:
The medial ligaments are located on the inner side of the elbow joint and consist of the following three ligaments:

   - Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL): This is the primary medial ligament of the elbow joint and is composed of three bands. The anterior band of the UCL is the most important for stability during the throwing motion and is commonly injured in baseball pitchers. The UCL connects the ulna bone to the humerus bone and provides medial stability to the elbow joint.

   - Anterior oblique ligament (AOL): This ligament is located just above the UCL and helps to stabilize the elbow joint during flexion.

   - Posterior oblique ligament (POL): This ligament is located just behind the UCL and helps to stabilize the elbow joint during extension.

2. Lateral ligaments:
The lateral ligaments are located on the outer side of the elbow joint and consist of the following three ligaments:

   - Radial collateral ligament (RCL): This is the primary lateral ligament of the elbow joint and connects the radius bone to the humerus bone. The RCL provides lateral stability to the elbow joint.

   - Lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL): This ligament is located just above the RCL and connects the ulna bone to the humerus bone. The LUCL provides additional lateral stability to the elbow joint.

   - Accessory lateral collateral ligament (ALCL): This is a small ligament that is located just below the RCL and provides additional lateral stability to the elbow joint.

3. Annular ligament:
The annular ligament is a ring-shaped ligament that wraps around the radial head and holds it in place, allowing for rotation of the forearm.

## Biomechanics of the elbow joint

### Flexion

The elbow joint has a range of flexion from 0&deg; to 130&deg;. The flexion is limited at 130&deg; by the contact of the coronoid process of ulna with the coronoid fossa of humerus and also by the contact between the soft tissues of the arm and forearm.

Normally the forearm is in slight valgus to the upper arm. The normal degree of valgus ranges from 5 to 15 degrees and depends on the gender and other bone parameters of the individual. However, the complex geometry of the elbow joint is such that when the elbow is flexed, the forearm lies in opposition to the upper arm rather than lying in valgus, thus, helping to reach the mouth and shoulder on flexion, but rather reach the perineum or carry goods with ease on extension.

The muscles involved in flexion at the elbow joint are biceps brachii, brachialis and brachioradialis. The biceps brachii muscle has two origins - A long head attached to the supraglenoid tubercle of scapula and a short head attached to the coracoid process of scapula. Biceps brachii inserts into the radial tuberosity. This helps in flexion of a supinated hand. On the other hand, the brachialis muscle originates from the anterior surface of distal humerus and inserts into the coronoid process of ulna. Since ulno-humeral joint is the primary hinge joint of elbow, brachialis is the primary flexor of the elbow joint. The other muscle which provides minor contributions to the flexion is the brachioradialis muscle. As the name suggests, it originates from the humerus, more precisely the lateral condyle of humerus and inserts into the distal end of radius. This makes it different from other muscles which insert into the proximal end of radius. Thus, providing an advantage of a longer effort arm in compromise for a reduced force of flexion. Whereas, the other muscles act at a shorter effort arm but have the added advantage of delivering more force. Together, brachioradialis, biceps brachii and brachialis can deliver an effortless flexion at the elbow joint.

### Extension

In a normal individual, the range of extension is 0&deg;, limited by the contact of the olecranon process with the olecranon fossa. However, some amount of hyperextension is possible in individuals with ligament laxity. The main function of extensors, however, lies in the restoration of a flexed elbow. The extensors of the elbow joint include triceps brachii, anconeus muscle and brachioradialis!

The triceps brachii muscle has three heads - a long head arising from the infra-glenoid tubercle, a lateral head arising from the superior end of radial groove and a medial head arising from the lower pole of the radial groove of humerus. The muscle inserts into the olecranon process of ulna and acts as the primary extensor of the elbow joint. It is supplement by a small muscle called the anconeus. It originates from the lateral condyle of humerus and inserts into the posterior aspect of upper ulna. It stabilizes the elbow during extension and acts as a synergist to triceps brachii. It also gives that radial tilt of forearm required for full extension, so that finally the forearm comes to lie in the carrying angle. Finally, brachioradialis surprisingly also contributes to the extension of the elbow joint. It is able to contribute to both flexion and extension due to its fibers coursing along the lateral aspect of the radius and finally inserting into the radial styloid.

### Forearm rotation

Forearm rotation unlocks a wide variety of activities that a human can achieve, starting from turning a door knob to tightening a screw. Apart from these, it also helps to keep the hand in various rotational positions so as to carry out various activities. For example, the forearm is kept in supination while eating and mild pronation while writing. The range of supination-pronation varies from 0 to 90&deg; on either sides, considering mid-pronation as the neutral position. 50 degrees of rotation on both sides is considered to be the functional range of forearm rotation.

During forearm rotation, the head of radius rotates within the annular ligament. The axis of rotation passes through the head and neck of the radius. However, due to the curvature in the shaft of radius and the slope in the shaft, the axis of rotation is located well outside the distal end of radius and it lies more closer to the ulna. As a result the distal and of radius rotates around the ulna, bringing forth supination and pronation. The head is free to rotate due to two main reasons - one, the capsule of elbow joint does not insert into the head or neck of radius. Instead it inserts into the annular ligament. So the head is free to rotate inside the annular ligament. Two, the radio capitular joint is a pivot joint. The hemispheric capitulum articulates with the hemispheric concavity present over the head of radius. This gives it rotational freedom of motion.

Muscles involved in forearm rotation are biceps brachii, supinator, pronator teres and pronator quadratus. Biceps brachii and supinator are the supinating muscles, whereas, pronator teres and pronator quadratus are the pronating muscles. The biceps brachii is considered to be a powerful supinator of the flexed elbow, which is self-explanatory due to its insertion into the radial tuberosity. The supinator muscle originates from the lateral epicondyle and inserts into the anterior border of the radius in the upper one-third. This insertion helps it to turn the radius outwards from a pronated position. It is a predominant supinator of an extended elbow.

The pronator teres muscle has two heads - one originating from the medial condyle and one originating from just medial to the ulnar tuberosity. The muscle then joins and inserts into the lateral aspect of the middle of the shaft of radius. When it contracts, it pulls the radius over the ulna. The pronator quadratus is a quadrilateral-shaped muscle originating from the medial aspect of distal one-third of ulna and inserting into the lateral aspect of distal one-third of radius. This muscle ensures that the distal radius rotates over the ulna and not merely translates over the ulna when pronator teres contracts.

## Congenital disorders of the elbow joint

### Congenital dislocation of the radial head

The patient presents with a lump that moves with forearm rotation. On X-Ray, the radial head is dome-shaped due to abnormal modeling. Usually, the patient presents surprisingly painless and with no restriction in movement, therefore surgery is not usually indicated. However, if there is difficulty in flexion at the elbow joint, the lump can be excised. Care must be taken to not injure the posterior interosseous nerve during surgery.

### Congenital synostosis (fusion)

Radio-humeral or ulno-humeral synostosis is very rare and is commonly associated with congenital deficiency of any forearm bone. Osteotomy can be done to position the forearm according to the patient's needs

Proximal radio-ulnar synostosis can affect forearm rotation but it rarely affects flexion and extension at the elbow joint. Surgery to gain rotation is often failed. Rotational osteotomy can be done to a suitable pronation supination angle tailored to the patient's needs.

## Acquired disorders of the elbow joint

### Cubitus valgus

The normal carrying angle is 5-15&deg; of valgus. Anything more than that is considered to be cubitus valgus. Cubitus valgus is most commonly caused due to chronic non-union of a lateral condylar fracture. The deformity is associated with marked prominence of the medial condylar outline. The importance of cubitus valgus lies in the risk of developing delayed ulnar nerve palsy in the future due to increased stretching of the nerve. Cubitus valgus, as such, need not be treated, but, when associated with ulnar nerve palsy, anterior transposition of ulnar nerve should be done. In ulnar nerve palsy, the patient presents with weakness of the hand and numbness over the ulnar fingers.

### Cubitus varus

It can be best appreciated when the elbow is at extension and the shoulders are 90&deg; abducted. It is also known as gunstock deformity due to its appearance in this position. The most common cause is a malunited supracondylar fracture of the humerus.
Treatment is a wedge osteotomy of the lower end of the humerus. Treatment is delayed till skeletal maturity is attained.

### Subluxation of the radial head

It is seen commonly when the ulna is disproportionately small, causing the radius to override the humerus. If troublesome, the radial head can be excised.

### Pulled elbow

It is a common condition seen in children below 6 years of age. In this condition, the head of the radius dislocates below the annular ligament. The child presents with forearm extended and pronated with an inability to supinate. Usually caused by an untimely elbow pull. It is a clinical diagnosis but an X-ray is warranted to rule out any fractures. Reduction of the dislocation can be done clinically. The child's attention is diverted, the forearm is quickly supinated and the elbow is slightly flexed. The head of the radius is relocated with a slight pop with relief of symptoms.

## Osteochondritis dissicans

It commonly affects the capitulum of the humerus in the elbow joint. It also affects other sites such as knee and ankle joints. It is characterized by osteonecrosis and inflammation at the site. Inflammation can lead to swelling, tenderness and joint effusion. The necrosed bone can fragment and form a loose body in the joint space. This causes the locking of the joint.

Initially, symptomatic treatment is done. In the presence of loose bodies, arthroscopic removal of loose bodies may be required to restore the joint function.

## Loose Bodies

Causes of loose bodies include osteocartilaginous fracture due to trauma, osteochondritis dissecans, osteoarthritis with separated osteophytes, and synovial chondromatosis. The patient presents with occasional locking and unlocking of the joint. X-ray is done to confirm the presence of loose bodies and the loose bodies are removed arthroscopically. However, the underlying pathology also needs to be treated.

## Tuberculosis of elbow

Accounts for 10% of total skeletal tuberculosis. The patient presents with aching and stiffness in the elbow joint. The patient presents with marked wasting. The joint is kept flexed, looks swollen and feels warm and diffusely tender. Movement is limited by pain and spasm. On X-ray, peri-articular osteoporosis, joint erosion and subchondral cysts are seen. Aspiration of the joint space or synovial biopsy will confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is by antitubercular therapy and splinting the elbow joint at 90 degrees of flexion and mid-rotation. Later on, if deformities persist, excisional or replacement arthroplasty or rarely, arthrodesis is done.

## Post-traumatic stiffness of elbow joint

This is a common condition seen in the elbow joint. The cause can be extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic causes may be soft tissue contractures and heterotopic ossification. Intrinsic causes include articular causes like intra-articular adhesions and articular incongruity.

> Heterotopic ossification is the formation of bone in abnormal locations

### Principles of management

Most of the activities of daily living can be maintained by attaining at least a movement range of flexion from 30 to 130 degrees and pronation-supination of 50 degrees each. Any range of movement less than this is considered disabling.

### Non-operative management

Prevention is better than cure. This condition can be prevented by early mobilization of the joint following trauma. However, if already the stiffness had set in, serial splintage may help.

### Operative management

> **Indications for operative management**
>
> - failure to regain a functional range of movements after one year
> - limb should be useful as a whole
> - there should not be any overriding neurological damage
> - In case of heterotopic bones, it should be mature, i.e, it should have formed the cortical and cancellous bone structures. If excised before maturity, there is a high chance of recurrence. After maturity, the osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities balance down.
> - Intrinsic causes should be ruled out before correcting extrinsic causes.

- Excision of heterotopic bone
- Capsular release or capsulectomy
- correction of non-union or mal-union
