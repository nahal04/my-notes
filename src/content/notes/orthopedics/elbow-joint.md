## Congenital disorders

### Congenital dislocation of the radial head

Patient presents with a lump that moves with forearm rotation. On X Ray the radial head is dome shaped due to abnormal modelling. Usually the patient presents surprisingly painless and no restriction in movement and therefore surgery is not usually indicated. However if there is difficulty in flexion at the elbow joint, the lump can be excised. Care must be taken to not injure the posterior interosseous nerve during surgery.

### Congenital synostosis (fusion)

Radio-humeral or ulnohumeral synostosis is very rare and is commonly associated with congenital deficiency of any forearm bone. Osteotomy can be done to position the forearm according to patient's needs

Proximal radio-ulnar synostosis can affect forearm rotation but it rarely affect flexion and extension at elbow joint. Surgery to gain rotation is often failed. Rotational osteotomy can be done to a suitable pronation supination angle tailored to the patient's needs.

## Acquired disorders of the elbow joint

### Cubitus valgus

The normal carrying angle is 5-15&deg; of valgus. Anything more than that is considered to be cubitus valgus. Cubitus valgus is most commonly caused due to chronic non union of a lateral condylar fracture. The deformity is associated with marked prominence of the medial condylar outline. The importance of cubitus valgus lies in the risk of developing delayed ulnar nerve palsy in the future due to increased stretching of nerve. Cubitus valgus, as such, need not be treated, but, when associated with ulnar nerve palsy, anterior transposition of ulnar nerve should be done. In ulnar nerve palsy, the patient presents with weakness of hand and numbness over the ulnar fingers.

### Cubitus varus

It can be best appreciated when elbow is at extension and shoulders are 90&deg; abducted. It is also known as gunstock deformity due to its appearance in this position. The most common cause is a malunited supracondylar fracture of humerus.
Treatment is a wedge osteotomy of the lower end of humerus. Treatment is delayed till skeletal maturity is attained.

### Subluxation of the radial head

It is seen commonly when the ulna is disproportionately small, causing the radius to override the humerus. If troublesome, the radial head can be excised.

### Pulled elbow

It is a common condition seen in children below 6 years of age. In this condition the head of the radius dislocates below the annular ligament. The child presents with forearm extended and pronated with inability to supinate. Usually caused by an untimely elbow pull. It is a clinical diagnosis but X ray is warranted to rule out any fractures. Reduction can be done clinically itself. The child's attention is diverted, the forearm is quickly supinated and the elbow is slightly flexed. Head of the radius is relocated with a slight pop with relief of symptoms. 

## Osteochondritis dissicans

It commonly affects the capitulum of humerus in the elbow joint. It also affects other sites such as knee and ankle joint. It is charecterised by osteonecrosis and inflammation at the site. Inflammation can lead to swelling, tenderness and joint effusion. The necrosed bone can fragment and form a loose body in the joint space. This causes locking of the joint.

Initially symptomatic treatment is done. In the presence of loose bodies, arthroscopic removal of loose bodies may be required to restore the joint function.

## Loose Bodies

Causes of loose bodies inlcude: osteocartilaginous fracture due to trauma, osteochondritis dissecans, osteoarthritis with seperated osteophytes, synovial chondromatosis. The patient presents with occasional locking and unlocking of the joint. X ray is done to confirm the presence of loose bodies and the loose bodies are removed arthroscopically. However, the underlying pathology also needs to be treated.
